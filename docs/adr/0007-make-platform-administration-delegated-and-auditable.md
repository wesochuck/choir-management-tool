# Make Platform Administration Delegated and Auditable

A Platform Administrator may enter any single Organization Scope and easily elevate from viewing to editing without acquiring an Organization Membership or impersonating another person. Elevation is explicit and visibly indicated for the active scope, expires when its bounded session ends, and every operational write records the Platform Administrator as its actor.

**Why:** Platform Administrators are expected to perform most Organization administration, so an exceptional, high-friction support workflow would obstruct the primary operating model. Direct delegated access preserves speed while single-Organization scoping, mandatory platform MFA, visible edit state, bounded elevation, and immutable attribution trade some separation of duties for practical managed-service operation.
