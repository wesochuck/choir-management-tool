# Promote One Commit Through Isolated Environments

The Cloudflare repository will use isolated local, permanent staging, and production environments. A commit merged to `main` deploys automatically to staging, runs integration and parity gates there, and requires one approval to deploy the same commit and lockfile with production bindings; staging and production have separate D1, Durable Objects, R2, queues, secrets, domains, and external-service modes.

**Why:** A permanent integration environment is necessary for whole-product parity, custom domains, email/SMS, Stripe Connect, and Cloudflare-native storage behavior, while separate code branches would create avoidable drift. Same-commit promotion trades the cost of maintaining duplicate environment resources and forward-compatible migrations for predictable releases, simple approvals, and rapid rollback to a prior production Worker version.
