# Centralize Identity and Require Platform Administrator MFA

The Cloudflare application will use Better Auth with its identity, session, invitation, and Organization Membership records stored in control-plane D1. Portal Sign-In is invitation-only, defaults to a verified-email one-time code, and permits a person to add a conventional password; multi-factor authentication is mandatory for Platform Administrators and optional for Organization Owners, Organization Administrators, and Organization Members.

**Why:** A central identity lets one person safely join multiple Organizations while the Better Auth Organization model matches the selected owner, administrator, and member roles. Email codes reduce password friction without eliminating conventional passwords, and mandatory MFA protects the only role with cross-Organization authority, trading uniform elevated-account MFA for a lower-friction policy chosen by each Organization.
