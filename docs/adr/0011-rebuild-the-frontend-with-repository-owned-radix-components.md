# Rebuild the Frontend with Repository-Owned Radix Components

The Cloudflare frontend will retain React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, TanStack Query, and TanStack Table while replacing Shoelace/Web Awesome wrappers with repository-owned shadcn-style components built on Radix primitives. The replacement must preserve semantic theme tokens, responsive table and card behavior, mobile dialog patterns, accessible controls, safe destructive confirmations, and the Parity Baseline's visual character.

**Why:** Frontend source compatibility is not required, and repository-owned components use patterns that AI coding tools understand more reliably while remaining directly inspectable and testable. This trades the current wrapper investment and exact underlying web-component behavior for stronger generation support, simpler customization, and an explicit Visual and Interaction Parity test suite.
