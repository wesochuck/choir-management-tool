# Separate Platform and Organization Email

Cloudflare Email Service will send only platform transactional messages from a platform-owned domain. Each Organization that uses campaign email or SMS—including newsletters, event invitations, reminders, and combined-channel sends—must connect an Organization-owned communications provider account and verified sending identities; Brevo is the first supported Organization Communications Provider behind a provider-neutral delivery interface.

**Why:** Cloudflare Email Service is intended for transactional email rather than marketing or bulk campaigns and does not replace the baseline's SMS capability, while shared campaign channels would make the free platform absorb sending cost and couple every Organization's deliverability reputation. Separate lanes trade additional Organization onboarding and encrypted provider-credential handling for clearer consent, branding, cost ownership, suppression behavior, and reputation isolation.
