# Glossary

## Organization

The independently managed performing group that forms the product's tenant boundary. An Organization owns one roster, event calendar, music catalog, configuration, files, communications, and commercial records; a person may belong to multiple Organizations with a separate membership and role in each.
_Avoid_: Tenant in user-facing language, Ensemble as a second hierarchy level

## Organization Membership

The relationship that grants a person access to one Organization and carries that person's Organization-specific role and profile. One identity may have multiple Organization Memberships, and changing a role or profile in one Organization does not affect the others.
_Avoid_: Global user role

## Organization Scope

The single Organization selected for an operational request or support action. Roster, event, music, communication, payment, and other domain operations never query across Organization Scopes; platform-wide views are limited to account metadata such as plan, usage, and health.
_Avoid_: Cross-Organization operational report

## Organization Scale Envelope

The supported planning target for a single Organization: up to 5,000 roster profiles, 100,000 patron/order/communication records, and 250 simultaneously active authenticated users, with short public traffic bursts. Expected Organizations are approximately one fifth of this size, and bulk communications, imports, and reports are asynchronous.
_Avoid_: Pricing quota, hard customer limit

## Organization Owner

An Organization Membership role responsible for the Organization's security and commercial boundary, including billing, ownership transfer, deletion, and Administrator management. Every Organization must retain at least one Organization Owner, and it may have more than one.
_Avoid_: Application Administrator

## Organization Administrator

An Organization Membership role with full operational control over the Organization's roster, events, music, communications, configuration, and commercial activity, but not its ownership boundary.
_Avoid_: Platform Administrator, Organization Owner

## Organization Member

An Organization Membership role with self-service access to the member-facing experience. Performer status, voice part, section leadership, and notification responsibilities are profile attributes rather than Organization Membership roles, and a profile may exist without login access.
_Avoid_: Singer as an authorization role

## Organization Profile

An Organization-owned record for a person who participates in its roster or administration. An Organization Profile may exist without login access and remains separate from the person's global identity and Organization Membership.
_Avoid_: User account, global person profile

## Organization Invitation

The manual workflow for granting portal access: an authorized person enters an email address and Organization Membership role, and the recipient activates or attaches their identity through an emailed invitation. Administrators do not create or handle another person's password; an Organization Profile may be created first and invited later.
_Avoid_: Public registration, administrator-assigned password

## Organization Subdomain

The Organization's canonical product hostname, such as `example-chorale.product.com`. It serves the complete public and authenticated application and remains available when the Organization also connects a Public Website Domain.
_Avoid_: Custom domain

## Public Website Domain

An optional Organization-owned hostname, including an apex domain or `www` hostname, that presents the Organization's public website, ticketing, donations, auditions, RSVPs, and personalized public links. Authenticated administration and member access continue on the Organization Subdomain.
_Avoid_: Authenticated application domain

## Portal Sign-In

The invitation-only authentication flow for identities with Organization access. A one-time code sent to the identity's verified email address is the primary method; a person may optionally establish and use their own conventional password as an alternative.
_Avoid_: Public sign-up, administrator-assigned password

## Platform Administrator

A platform-level identity authorized to manage all Organizations and platform configuration. Platform Administrators are outside Organization Membership roles and must use multi-factor authentication; Organization Owners and Organization Administrators may enable multi-factor authentication but are not required to do so.
_Avoid_: Super admin, Organization Administrator

## Delegated Administration

The routine workflow in which a Platform Administrator selects one Organization Scope and performs operational administration without impersonating an Organization member. Editing is enabled through an easy, explicit elevation for the current scope, remains visibly identified as platform activity, and attributes every change to the Platform Administrator.
_Avoid_: User impersonation, exceptional support access

## Organization Audit History

The Organization-visible record of administrative changes, including actions performed through Delegated Administration. It identifies the real actor, time, action, and affected record; private platform notes, billing-risk flags, and abuse investigations are not part of this history.
_Avoid_: Impersonation log, private platform operations log

## Connected Payment Account

The Organization-owned payment-processing account that receives its ticket, donation, dues, and bundle revenue. The Organization is the merchant of record and owns processing fees, refunds, disputes, reporting, and negative-balance liability; the platform never receives or commingles this revenue.
_Avoid_: Platform payment account, shared Stripe account

## Platform Access

The free, Platform Administrator-provisioned right for an Organization to use the software. Modules are enabled as product configuration rather than paid entitlements, and the platform has no plans, trials, subscriptions, or usage billing.
_Avoid_: Platform Subscription, paid plan, billing entitlement

## Platform Transactional Email

A security or system message sent by the platform, including Portal Sign-In codes, Organization Invitations, security alerts, domain-verification notices, and system failures. It uses a platform-owned sending domain and is operationally separate from Organization Communications.
_Avoid_: Newsletter, event campaign, Organization announcement

## Organization Communications Provider

The Organization-owned communications service and verified sending identities used for campaign email and SMS, including newsletters, event invitations, reminders, and combined Email/SMS sends. Organizations connect their own provider account so sending cost, branding, consent, suppression behavior, and reputation remain isolated; Brevo is the initial supported provider.
_Avoid_: Platform Transactional Email, shared platform campaign sender, platform-funded SMS

## Functional Parity Release

The first production release of the Cloudflare application, which must include every current product module and all current user-visible behavior and visual character. Internal implementation phases are engineering milestones only and do not authorize a partial production launch; the release begins with empty Organization data rather than migrating PocketBase records.
_Avoid_: Minimum viable product, phased production launch, data migration

## Parity Baseline

The current PocketBase application at commit `6874d43a3c3698ae53218a44d17649bc454ca9ac`, used as the stable behavioral and visual reference for the Functional Parity Release. Executable code and tests establish implemented behavior; non-PocketBase `AGENTS.md` rules remain normative, while design and plan documents provide intent and acceptance details but are not by themselves proof that a proposed feature exists.
_Avoid_: Moving target, treating every historical plan as implemented scope

## Parity Bridge

The development-only, read-only relationship between the new `choir-management-cloudflare` repository and the Parity Baseline repository. Local AI tools may inspect both sibling repositories, while approved contracts, fixtures, screenshots, CSV formats, glossary entries, and ADRs are copied into the new repository so its tests, builds, deployments, and runtime never depend on legacy source availability.
_Avoid_: Runtime cross-repository import, production dependency, mutable legacy reference

## Environment Promotion

The release process in which one commit and lockfile deploy automatically to an isolated permanent staging environment, passes integration and parity gates, and is then approved for deployment with production bindings. Staging and production never use separate code branches or manual file transfer, and production retains a known-good Worker version for rollback.
_Avoid_: Staging branch, cherry-picked production release, shared staging/production data

## Organization Scheduler

The alarm state owned by one Organization's Durable Object. It records the next due Organization work, wakes only that Organization, creates idempotent jobs for reminders, reports, checkout cleanup, and queued communications, and advances its alarm after the transaction commits. External delivery and retry execution occurs through queues rather than inside the alarm.
_Avoid_: Platform-wide operational scan, one global tenant cron loop

## Delivery Job

An idempotent unit of asynchronous work for exactly one Organization, such as sending one email or SMS, generating an attendance report, or reconciling a payment event. Queue delivery is treated as at-least-once, so the Organization store records a stable idempotency key and terminal outcome before repeated delivery can cause another side effect.
_Avoid_: Exactly-once assumption, cross-Organization batch

## Published Projection

A read-optimized, cacheable representation of an Organization's public website, public event, ticket, donation, audition, RSVP, or player data. The Organization store remains authoritative; publishing a relevant change produces a new projection version so public traffic can be served at the edge without making every request contend on the Organization's Durable Object.
_Avoid_: Second source of truth, editable cache

## Visual and Interaction Parity

Preservation of the Parity Baseline's recognizable visual character, responsive behavior, accessibility, interaction safety, and user workflows without preserving its frontend source code or component library. Semantic theme tokens, responsive table/card behavior, mobile dialogs, confirmation patterns, and meaningful loading/error/empty states are part of parity.
_Avoid_: Pixel-for-pixel source reproduction, retaining Shoelace solely for implementation continuity

## Structured Public Website

The Organization's configurable public experience on its Public Website Domain: branded hero content, About and History Markdown, featured and past performances, and module-aware navigation to performances, tickets, donations, and auditions. It is driven by Organization content and product records rather than arbitrary pages, posts, or a drag-and-drop page builder.
_Avoid_: General-purpose CMS, blog platform, custom page builder

## Organization Export

A portable ZIP archive of one Organization's settings, operational records, audit history, and uploaded files, available to its Owners and Platform Administrators. It reuses the Parity Baseline's established CSV contracts for roster, music library, event RSVP roster, donations, attendance, repertoire history, and will-call data, and adds JSON only where CSV would lose structure; the Functional Parity Release does not include Organization deletion, timed recovery, automated purge, restoration, or whole-archive import.
_Avoid_: Platform-wide export, backup-and-restore system

### Example Dialogue

> **Administrator:** I help manage two choirs that use the application separately.
> **Developer:** Those are two Organizations. You can use one identity to belong to both, while each Organization keeps its own roster, settings, and records.
> **Support:** I need to investigate an event-delivery problem.
> **Developer:** Enter that Organization's scope first; support tools do not search message or roster data across Organizations.
> **Director:** Our accompanist needs portal access but does not sing.
> **Developer:** Give them an Organization Member membership without a voice part; Performer eligibility remains a profile attribute.
> **Administrator:** I want to add the whole roster before everyone needs an account.
> **Developer:** Create their Organization Profiles now, then send Organization Invitations only to the people who need portal access.
> **Owner:** We want `examplechorale.org` to be our public website.
> **Developer:** Connect it as the Public Website Domain; account management and the member portal remain at your Organization Subdomain.
> **Member:** I would rather use a password than request a code each time.
> **Developer:** Add your own password to the identity and choose “Use password instead” during Portal Sign-In.
> **Owner:** Do I need multi-factor authentication to manage my Organization?
> **Developer:** It is optional for Organization roles but mandatory for every Platform Administrator who can manage Organizations globally.
> **Platform Administrator:** I am handling this Organization's event setup today.
> **Developer:** Enter its Organization Scope and enable editing; every change remains attributed to your Platform Administrator identity.
> **Owner:** Did our Administrator or the platform change this event?
> **Developer:** The Organization Audit History shows the actual actor and the affected event.
> **Treasurer:** Where does a ticket buyer's payment settle?
> **Developer:** It goes directly to the Organization's Connected Payment Account; Platform Access is free and never participates in that transaction.
> **Administrator:** Can the platform send our event newsletter from its login-code address?
> **Developer:** No. Connect the Organization Communications Provider and its verified sending identity for campaigns.
> **Owner:** Can we launch the new application after only roster and events are ready?
> **Developer:** No. Those are internal milestones; the Functional Parity Release waits for every current module and workflow.
> **Developer:** A historical plan describes an extra workflow that is absent from the code and tests.
> **Owner:** Treat it as design context, not parity scope, unless we deliberately add it to the new product.
> **Developer:** I need to compare the rebuilt RSVP flow with the baseline.
> **Owner:** Use the Parity Bridge to inspect the pinned repository, then capture the approved contract in the new repository.
> **Owner:** Staging passed. What changes when we release?
> **Developer:** Environment Promotion deploys the same tested commit with production resources and secrets.
> **Designer:** The rebuilt dialog uses a different component primitive but looks and behaves the same.
> **Developer:** That satisfies Visual and Interaction Parity when responsiveness, accessibility, and safety behavior also match.
> **Owner:** Can I publish an arbitrary blog inside the public site?
> **Developer:** Not in the Functional Parity Release; the Structured Public Website focuses on the Organization's existing content and public modules.
> **Owner:** I need a copy of everything our Organization has stored.
> **Developer:** Generate an Organization Export; it contains only that Organization's records and files.

## First-Run Setup

The resumable initialization journey for one Organization. A Platform Administrator may create, configure, and launch the Organization before any Owner activates an account; invited Owners may later continue or revise Organization settings, enabled Modules, integrations, initial data, and readiness work.

## Organization Launch

The explicit transition that opens an Organization's enabled public and authenticated product areas after required First-Run Setup items are complete. Organization Launch is independent of whether an invited Owner has activated an identity; optional or integration-dependent Modules may remain unavailable until their own readiness checks pass.

## Legacy Application Administrator

The Parity Baseline's global PocketBase administrative-user role. It informs behavior to preserve but is replaced in the Cloudflare model by Organization Owner, Organization Administrator, and Platform Administrator.
_Avoid_: Application Administrator as a new authorization role

## Module

A product capability that an organization may enable or disable without deleting its existing data. A disabled Module is intentionally unused rather than incomplete.

## Readiness Item

A measurable setup task associated with System Configuration or a Module. It is complete, incomplete, or not applicable when its owning Module is disabled.

### Example Dialogue

> **Owner:** We do not sell tickets, so Ticket Sales should not keep First-Run Setup incomplete.  
> **Developer:** Disable that Module. Its Readiness Items become not applicable, its data remains intact, and you can enable it later from System Settings.  
> **Owner:** I still need to configure email for Communications.  
> **Developer:** Leave Communications enabled; its verification stays as an incomplete Readiness Item after launch.
> **Platform Administrator:** The invited Owner has not activated an account yet.
> **Developer:** You may still complete First-Run Setup and perform Organization Launch; the Owner can join later.

## Voice Part Definition

A classification of a singer's vocal range and role within the choir (e.g., Soprano 1, Bass 2). Admins can customize the list of voice parts in settings, defining a short label (e.g., "S1"), a descriptive full name (e.g., "Soprano 1"), and optionally a custom color for visual identity on seating charts.

## Personalized Magic Link

A secure, uniquely generated URL sent to a singer that allows them to perform a specific action (e.g., RSVP, respond to a poll, access the music player) without requiring a standard password login. These links use signed tokens to verify the singer's identity and the intended action.

## Engagement Poll

A targeted question sent to singers via Personalized Magic Links to gather volunteers or information for specific event-related tasks (e.g., moving risers) or organizational needs (e.g., general skill sets). Polls are created directly within the Communications interface during message composition. Singers can toggle or edit their responses at any time via their personalized link.

## Voluntary Assignment

A record of a singer's affirmative response to an Engagement Poll. These assignments allow administrators to track volunteer names and total counts to assess organizational capability for specific tasks.

## Polls Dashboard

A central management interface for reviewing affirmative responses to Engagement Polls. The dashboard provides an overview of volunteer counts and detailed lists of specific singer names to help administrators assess organizational capability. Event-linked polls are grouped by performance/rehearsal and automatically archive when the event passes.

## RSVP Status

The attendance response provided by or assigned to a singer for a specific event. Can be:

- **Yes (Attending)**: Singer expects to perform or rehearse.
- **No (Declined)**: Singer is unavailable.
- **Pending (No Response)**: The default status indicating no selection has been made yet.

## RSVP Balance

A real-time breakdown of RSVP statuses grouped by voice parts. This allows directors to quickly identify imbalances (e.g., zero or low Tenor 1 attendance) before rehearsals or performances.

## RSVP Decline Notice

An automated email notification sent to administrators who have opted to receive alerts when a singer declines a rehearsal or performance RSVP. It includes the singer's name, voice part, the event, and any reason or note provided by the singer.

## Catalog Lookup URL Template

A configurable URL format defined in settings that enables automatic linking of music piece Catalog IDs to external publisher/sheet music databases (e.g. J.W. Pepper). The placeholder `{catalogId}` is replaced dynamically with the piece's specific catalog number to build the hyperlink.

## Reference Recording

An audio track (typically MP3) attached to a piece in the Music Library. Used by administrators for archive management and made available to singers for practice and learning when the piece is included in their set list.

## Set List

A curated sequence of music pieces and intermissions scheduled to be performed or rehearsed at a specific event. It displays song titles, composers, durations, running timestamps, and linked practice audio, and can be approved by administrators to be visible to singers on their dashboard.

## Featured Number

A song on an event's **Set List** that highlights an ordered set of **Performer Credits**. It is presented as a Solo when it has one credit, a Group when it has multiple credits, or Performers TBA when it has none.
_Avoid_: Solo / Small Group flag

## Performer Credit

The stable public name of a roster performer or guest attached to a **Featured Number**. Credits retain their billing order and captured names so an event's published program remains historically accurate.
_Avoid_: Cast member, assignee

### Example Dialogue

> **Director:** This piece is a Featured Number for Morgan, with guest artist Riley listed second.  
> **Developer:** I’ll add two Performer Credits in that billing order, so the Set List presents it as a Group.  
> **Director:** The soloist for the next performance is not chosen yet.  
> **Developer:** That Featured Number can remain Performers TBA until its Performer Credit is selected.

## Multi-Work Piece

A sheet music catalog record representing a compound musical work consisting of multiple distinct sections or movements (e.g. masses, cantatas, or oratorios).

## Section Bucket

A top-level classification used to group related voice parts (e.g., "Sopranos" as a bucket for "S1" and "S2"). These buckets serve as the primary units for standard seating distribution, filtering, and visual identification throughout the application.

## Seating Formation

A global, reusable configuration template managed in system settings that defines the layout strategy (Columns or Rows) and the sequence of categories (either Section Buckets or Voice Parts) used by the auto-paint engine to fill stage layouts. Can optionally be configured in "Voice Part Layout" mode to lay out and mismatch-check by exact voice parts instead of top-level section buckets.

## Seating Column

A vertical slice of a seating layout extending from the front row to the back row across all tiers.

## Seating Row

A horizontal tier of seats on a stage layout arranged sequentially from front to back.

## Distinct Section Palette

A predefined set of high-contrast color values assigned to section and voice part definitions to guarantee clear visual separation on seating charts and grid layouts.

## Unassigned Singer Dock

A shelf at the bottom of the seating chart containing active singers who have not yet been assigned to a seat. It dynamically groups unassigned singers into columns/lanes matching the active formation (either section buckets or voice parts), displaying only the categories that are present in the formation.

## Automated Reminder

A scheduled outbound message automatically triggered before an event starts. Configured on a per-event basis via an `enableAutomatedReminder` flag and a `reminderLeadTimeHours` lead time. Dispatch state is tracked via a `reminderSentAt` timestamp to prevent duplicate sends. Reminders are exclusively sent to active singers whose RSVP Status is "Yes (Attending)" for the target event roster. For Rehearsals linked to a parent Performance, the Rehearsal's own RSVP list is completely ignored, and reminders are instead sent to the "Yes (Attending)" roster of the parent Performance.

## Attendance Report

A post-event summary automatically generated and sent to administrators after a rehearsal or performance. It provides attendance rates, absentee lists, and threshold warnings based on the recorded roster.

## Communication History

A central log of all dispatched messages, including manual bulk emails/SMS and those triggered by automated system tasks.

## Message Draft

A partially composed or unsent message that is saved to the database (with a status of "Draft") for future refinement, recipient filtering, and dispatch.

## Message Template

A reusable layout or pre-written text block containing placeholders. Templates can optionally have a `systemRole` (e.g., 'performance_reminder', 'rehearsal_reminder') allowing background tasks to automatically locate and dispatch them without manual selection.

## Event Cloning

A function that duplicates an existing Performance, copying its title, date/time, details, and venue into a new event record with RSVPs (Event Roster responses) copied over, while keeping the set list empty, setting attendance/folder stats to default, and keeping its initial RSVP state closed.

## Seating Chart

A physical arrangement of singers in rows and columns on a stage or venue layout. A single performance can support multiple distinct seating charts, each identified by a custom user-defined name (e.g., "Chamber Choir", "Combined Finale"). Each seating chart is linked to a Seating Formation, which dynamically filters the unassigned singer pool and available seats to match only the voice parts or section buckets specified in that formation.

## Standing Neighbors HUD

A user interface component in the seating finder that displays the names and voice parts of the immediate standing neighbors (Left, Right, Behind, In Front) relative to the singer's assigned seat.

## Seating Grid Mirroring

A layout rendering strategy for the stage finder that positions Row 1 (the physical front row of the stage, closest to the director and audience) at the bottom of the screen, and the last row (the physical back row/tier) at the top of the screen, aligning with a singer's forward-facing perspective looking toward the podium.

## Performance Recency

The elapsed time since a music piece was last performed. In the music library, this is calculated dynamically using the date of the most recent linked performance event.

## Performance Recency Filter

A search control in the music catalog that filters pieces based on how recently they were performed (e.g. within the last 1, 2, or 3 years, not performed for over 3 or 5 years, or never performed).

## Composer

The individual(s) who wrote the original musical work. Stored in the `composer` field of a music library piece.

## Arranger

The individual(s) who adapted or arranged the original musical work for a specific vocal setting or instrumentation. Stored in the new `arranger` field of a music library piece.

## Calendar Subscription Feed

A secure, personalized iCalendar (.ics) feed URL that allows singers to sync their choir event schedules (including rehearsals and performances) directly into external calendar applications.

## Calendar Salt

A unique, cryptographically random string stored on a singer's profile that is signed into their Calendar Subscription Feed URL. Re-generating this salt instantly invalidates any previously shared subscription links.

## Audition Inquiry

A request submitted by a prospective singer via the public audition form, detailing their name, contact information, preferred audition time slots, voice part, and musical experience.

## Singer Resource

A document (such as a PDF handbook) or an external hyperlink (such as a Google Drive folder) managed by administrators and made available to all active singers under the Resources section of their dashboard.

## Ticket Bundle

An administrative grouping of multiple upcoming performances offered for sale as a single package (e.g., a "Season Ticket"). A bundle defines its own single, fixed price, total capacity, and public marketing details. The effective available capacity of a bundle is strictly limited by the lowest remaining capacity of any individual performance included in the package, preventing accidental overselling of popular events. A bundle automatically expires and becomes unavailable for purchase once the first included performance has occurred.

## Season Ticket

A bundled purchase option that allows a buyer to purchase admission to a defined set of upcoming performances in a single transaction. Upon successful checkout, the system automatically generates individual standard Will Call Ticket Purchase records for each included performance, ensuring compatibility with existing door-entry, capacity, and communication logic. These individual records are linked by a shared Stripe transaction ID, meaning refunds are processed on an all-or-nothing basis for the entire package.

## Will Call Ticket Purchase

A record of a successful general admission ticket transaction for a Performance, detailing the buyer's name, email, purchased quantity, payment status, and Stripe session reference. Used by administrators to manage door admission via a printed or digital will call list.

## Ticketing Configuration

Settings defined on a Performance event that enable ticket sales, set the single ticket price, and specify the maximum ticket capacity for the event.

## Advance Ticket Price

The price charged for a ticket purchased online in advance of the performance day.

## Day-of Ticket Price

The higher price charged for a ticket purchased online on the day of the performance.

## Discount Code

A code entered by a buyer at checkout to apply a percentage or fixed discount to their ticket purchase, leveraging Stripe's native Checkout Promotion Codes.

## System Configuration

Organization-wide, infrastructure-level settings reserved for the central `SettingsView`. Examples: `choirName`, SMTP server, payment gateways, global auth providers. Stored as key-value entries in the `appSettings` PocketBase collection. Any new entry requires a corresponding forward migration.

## Feature Configuration

Settings that configure a specific feature's behavior or define templates/presets for that feature. Configured directly inside the relevant product view under a settings/config tab, NOT in the global `SettingsView`. Examples: Roster Settings (Voice Parts, Season, Section Buckets & Colors) inside `RosterView`, Music Catalog Settings (Genres, Catalog URL Lookup) inside the Music Library, Seating Formations Templates inside `SeatingView`. Draft state is managed with a `FloatingSaveBar` and persisted via `dialog.confirm`/`dialog.showMessage` flows.

## View Preferences (Server-Side User Preferences)

Personal, per-user view state (sorting selections, view modes, personal filters) stored on the `users` collection in a flexible JSON field named `preferences`. Never clutter the administrative system settings database with these. Exposed and configured in a single "View Preferences" section of the user's `ProfileView` so both singers and admins can manage device-spanning view behavior in one hub. Type-safe merging lives in `src/lib/userPreferences.ts`, and `useAuth()` exposes `updatePreferences(partialPreferences)` for writes. Feature views should load preferences with sensible local defaults and trigger seamless persistence on change, without showing verbose "preference saved" banners.
